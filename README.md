This project focuses on creating a predictive model to forecast a student's academic performance in the third semester by analyzing their first and second-semester grades alongside relevant background information. The primary goal is to give students early feedback, allowing them to identify weaknesses and leverage their strengths. By providing personalized guidance and support, the project aims to enhance academic achievement, build confidence, and unlock potential for future success. The system tracks daily performance and maintains records for teachers to analyze, helping students excel in their studies and advance their careers. The predictive model, implemented using the CatBoost algorithm, is hosted on a Flask server with data managed by a MySQL database. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a customizable and easily navigable interface, ensuring a user-friendly experience. Informed by extensive research on how background characteristics influence student performance, this project adopts a data-driven approach to improving student outcomes.
